###Problem #1 – Logical Operators: Making The Grade
In this program i will ask	the user for 2 grades. i validate both grades to make sure they are numbersand store the	converted number values in 1 array with 2 elements. 

Then i created a single conditional that would determine if	both grades are both 70 or above. If they are,i told the user that both grades	are	passing. If one or both of the grades are lower than 70, i told the user to try harder next time. I used the array values inside of the conditional tests.

###Problem	#2 – Logical Operators: Brunch Bunch

The	local dinner	offers	brunch	on	Sunday	for a set price of $15.00. However they also	offer a discount to senior	citizens (55 and	older). Their	 cost is only $10.00. They	also offer the same	discounted cost to kids (Under 10).

I created a single conditional block that would determine which of the	two prices the customer is eligible for.

###Problem	#3 – For	Loop:	Add Them	 Up
In	this problem i will be asking the user for the number	of	different	movie types they own and add them all up.

Prompt	the user for the	number	of	DVDs,Blu-Rays and Digital UltraViolet copies they own. I validated each of the	 3	prompts and create a number array that will hold the converted values.	

Next i used a for loop	to	cycle through the array and add up the total	number	of	movies	that the user owns.
Once i have the total, i used a conditional to test if the user has 100	movies	or	more. If they	 have less, give them their	total. If	they 100 or more, i tell the user that i am impressed with their collection.

###Problem	#4 – While	Loop:	Cha-Ching!

In	this problem	the	 user is given a	gift card for a store.	They are going to keep buying	items until they go over the amount of their card.

I will ask the user for the gift card amount first.
Then create a	 while	loop that	will start deducting each purchase from	 the card. As	long as the money on the card is	above	zero,	the while	loop should continue looping. When the user	 spends their entire gift card, stop the loop and i tell	them how much	 they went over by.
